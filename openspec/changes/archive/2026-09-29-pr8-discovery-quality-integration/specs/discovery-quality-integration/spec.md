# PR8 discovery quality integration

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Pi consumes Core token-limit semantics
Pi SHALL expose the context and output limits selected by Core without reinterpreting the discovery sources.

#### Scenario: Core total context differs from LiteLLM max input
- **WHEN** PR8 Core resolves a model to a total context that differs from LiteLLM `max_input_tokens`
- **THEN** the Pi provider model uses Core `limit.context` as `contextWindow` and preserves Core `limit.output` as `maxTokens`
